# GamerBoom: the One-stop Gaming Social Hub
GamerBoom is a Web3 gaming social hub built upon mainstream WEB2 games like League of Legends. GamerBoom is built to create an ecosystem that help digital-native gamers, community and brands monetize and tokenize their intrinsic value and influence to the fullest extent. GameBoom enables gamers to enjoy a silky-smooth gaming experience while unlocking a wide range of rewards from the WEB3 system.

# Rinku Protocol: Where Gaming Meets Web3
Our current product matrix primarily consists of two parts: GamerBoom Client and Rinku Protocol. The GamerBoom Client is tailored to provide traditional gamers with effortless access to the Web3 realm, allowing them to earn rewards while gaming without disrupting their gaming experience. In contrast, the Rinku Protocol is a decentralized monetization protocol based on a bonding curve mechanism. It is designed to provide a monetization method for all intangible assets like influence, items, UGC, etc.

# Contracts Interaction Diagram
This repository contains a set of Solidity smart contracts and an interaction diagram that explains the relationships between them. The diagram illustrates the order of contract deployment, the interactions between the different contracts, and the internal functions of each contract.

You can view the UML diagram below:
