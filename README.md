# GamerBoom: The Web3 Portal for Onboarding Billions of Gamers
GamerBoom is a Web3 gaming portal built on popular Web2 games like League of Legends. It helps gamers tokenize their intrinsic value, offering a seamless gaming experience with diverse Web3 features, including decentralization, trustlessness, crypto incentives, etc.

# Rinku Protocol: Where Gaming Meets Web3
Our current product matrix primarily consists of two parts: GamerBoom Client and Rinku Protocol. The GamerBoom Client is tailored to provide traditional gamers with effortless access to the Web3 realm, allowing them to earn rewards while gaming without disrupting their gaming experience. In contrast, the Rinku Protocol is a decentralized monetization protocol based on a bonding curve mechanism. It is designed to provide a monetization method for all intangible assets like influence, items, UGC, etc.

# Basic Contracts Interaction Flow of Rinku Protocol
This repository contains a set of Solidity smart contracts and an interaction diagram that explains the relationships between them. The diagram illustrates the order of contract deployment, the interactions between the different contracts, and the internal functions of each contract.

You can view the UML diagram below:
